# Food-Cost-Warning-Prediction-App
This repo contains the code for deploying a chat-bot web application for interacting with stored predictions of the severity of future price spikes in food markets. The price spike severity data was generated by the MSOE Research Team NourishNet using their food market prediction and classification models. ![Link to the NourishNet repository](https://github.com/Benja-Pauls/Predicting-Commodity-Food-Pricing). <br><br>
